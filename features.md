# DataWake Prefetch
Datawake prefetch allows a user to define entities and initiate a crawl of all websites
containing those entities.

First we are going to add an entity.

Now we are going to exclude pages relating to baseball.  
![Add Irrelevant Entities](img/addIrEntites.png)  

Now we can look at pages and how they rank given the defined entities.
