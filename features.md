# DataWake Prefetch
Datawake prefetch allows a user to define entities and initiate a crawl of all websites
containing those entities.

First we are going to add an entity.  
![Add Entities](../img/addEntities.png)  

Now we are going to exclude pages relating to baseball.  
![Add Irrelevant Entities](../img/addIrEntities.png)  

Now we can look at pages and how they rank given the defined entities.  
![Explore](../img/viewingPages.png)
