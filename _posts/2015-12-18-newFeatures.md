title: Domain Discovery and Domain Building with Datawake.
---

New functionality this week centers on Domain Discovery, enabling a user to easily append terms to a domain while browsing.  As users browse a page the page contents are sent to a real time extractor that identifies entities within the webpage and presents them to user in the panel on the right.  Suggested entities are sorted by their frequency of appearance on the page.  Users may click on the most relevant terms to add them to their Domain as "domain items".
