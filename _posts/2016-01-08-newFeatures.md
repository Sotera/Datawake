title: Domain Discovery Summary Export, Toolbar expanded functionality
---

New functionality this week continues to focus on Domain Discovery.  Building upon the ability to append domain terms and types, we now perform operations to identify the the most frequently occuring items.  We've added the ability to export a "Domain Summary", which is a JSON document that can be used as a seed list for other processess such as crawlers.  The Datawake Firefox plugin has also undergone some changes. In response to feedback we've simplified the plugin Toolbar by removing redundant dropdowns and adding the ability to create a new Trail directly.  We also added toggle buttons to show/hide Domain items and the Datawake Panel as you trail.
