title: View Search Terms, Entity Cloud, and Extraction information from the plugin.
---

New functionality this week includes displaying search terms used on the "Visited Links" tab, displaying multiple entity types for entities on the "Entities" tab, and the creation of the "Word Cloud" tab which displays a word cloud of the entities extracted for the graphed trail. Future plans for the word cloud include a search term cloud as well as an entity cloud for the entire domain.
