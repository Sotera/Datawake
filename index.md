The Datawake project consists of various server and database
technologies along with a Firefox plugin that aggregate user browsing data via a
plug-in using domain-specific searches. This captured, or extracted, data is
organized into browse paths and elements of interest. The data can then be
analyzed by the user or a team and used to seed crawlers.
