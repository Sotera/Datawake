The Datawake project consists of various server and database
technologies along with a Firefox plugin that aggregate user browsing data via a
plug-in using domain-specific searches. This captured, or extracted, data is
organized into browse paths and elements of interest. The data can then be
analyzed by the user or a team and used to seed crawlers.

## Applied Technology  ##
This work was funded by [DARPA's
Memex](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Memex.aspx) program
and leverages several technologies from [DARPA's Open
Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/).  DataWake is available on the [Memex Open Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/MEMEX.html)  

# Datawake utilizes the following Darpa technology #
[MITIE: MIT Information Extraction](https://github.com/mitll/MITIE) - MIT-LL  
[Topic Clustering](https://github.com/mitll/topic-clustering) - MIT-LL
