The Datawake project consists of various server and database
technologies that aggregate user browsing data via a plug-in using
domain-specific searches. This captured, or extracted, data is organized
into browse paths and elements of interest.

This work was funded by [DARPA's
Memex](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Memex.aspx) program
and leverages several technologies from [DARPA's Open
Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/).
