# Introduction

The Datawake demo environment consists of a Docker container that can be
run within your native OS or within the Demo Virtual Machine using
Virtual Box.  

# Installation Types

## Preconfigured Virtual Machine

The simplest demo environment setup can be achieved utilizing the Demo
Virtual Machine (VM). It will allow you to run a complete standalone
Datawake instance consisting of Docker, the Datawake Docker Container
and Firefox with the installed Datawake plugin. The VM requires
virtually no setup aside from running the VM on your machine. It should
be noted that data tracked will not be permanently persisted to the VM,
that is each time you restart the VM or Docker you will be working only
with the pre-loaded demo data in the VM.

Files Needed:

### Instructions

1.  Download and install the Virtual Box version pertaining to your
    operating system from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
1.  Copy the Datawake Demo Virtual Machine to your preferred location
1.  Select “Machine, Add” and browse to the location of your copy of the
    VM. Select the DataWakeDemoVM.vbox file.
1.  Start the VM, the user and password are “demo”,”demo”

1. Click the “Start” button to begin tracking.
1. Click the blue “click for forensic trail viewer” button to see your
    trails in the Forensic Viewer.
1. Your Datawake Demo VM is now functional.

## Docker & Docker Container

Should you wish to have a local installation that doesn't require the
use of a VM, the Docker container can be installed within your local
Docker instance. This may require some additional configuration within
your environment, as the Docker container’s webserver uses port 80.
